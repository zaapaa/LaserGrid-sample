# Laser Grid

Laser Grid is a 2D multiplayer space shooter game.
I was part of the development from the start for a few months.

### What I did?
* Programmed basic game and basic mechanics like flying, collisions, shooting, powerup usage
* In-game networking stuff (using Unity networking)
* Majority of the powerups, for example laser and lightning. I really like how lightning turned out. More about these below.
* Even worked on an experimental pixel-based destructable environment using quadtrees, but it was too slow and buggy. [Code sample](https://github.com/zaapaa/LaserGrid-sample/tree/master/pixelCollider)
* Set up everything together in Unity
* Infinite scrolling on Limbo level (up/down)
